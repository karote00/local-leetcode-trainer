# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dynamic LeetCode integration system currently has a fallback mechanism that activates when LeetCode blocks API requests (403 errors). However, this fallback system generates incomplete problem files with minimal descriptions and empty test files, making the practice experience poor when the primary API is unavailable. This feature will enhance the fallback system to provide rich, complete problem data that matches the quality of live LeetCode problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer practicing coding problems, I want the fallback system to provide complete problem descriptions, so that I can understand the problem requirements even when LeetCode API is blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LeetCode API returns 403 error THEN the fallback system SHALL provide detailed problem descriptions with examples
2. WHEN a fallback problem is generated THEN it SHALL include problem constraints and edge cases
3. WHEN a user reads a fallback problem THEN it SHALL contain sufficient detail to solve the problem without external references
4. IF the problem has multiple examples THEN the fallback SHALL include at least 2-3 representative examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the practice tool, I want fallback problems to include comprehensive test cases, so that I can validate my solution thoroughly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fallback problem is created THEN it SHALL include multiple test cases covering edge cases
2. WHEN test cases are generated THEN they SHALL include both basic and advanced scenarios
3. WHEN a user runs tests on fallback problems THEN they SHALL get meaningful feedback on solution correctness
4. IF a problem has specific constraints THEN the test cases SHALL validate those constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fallback problems to maintain LeetCode formatting and structure, so that the practice experience is consistent regardless of data source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fallback problems are generated THEN they SHALL follow standard LeetCode problem format
2. WHEN problem templates are created THEN they SHALL include proper function signatures for all supported languages
3. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL use LeetCode's input/output format conventions
4. IF the problem includes data structures THEN the fallback SHALL provide appropriate type definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fallback system to provide problems across different difficulty levels and topics, so that I can practice diverse coding challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fallback system activates THEN it SHALL provide problems from easy, medium, and hard difficulties
2. WHEN problems are selected THEN they SHALL cover various algorithmic topics (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, etc.)
3. WHEN a user requests a specific difficulty THEN the fallback SHALL respect that preference
4. IF no specific topic is requested THEN the fallback SHALL provide a balanced mix of problem types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fallback system to be transparent about its limitations, so that I understand when I'm working with fallback data versus live LeetCode problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the user
2. WHEN a fallback problem is displayed THEN it SHALL include a notice about the data source
3. WHEN users encounter fallback problems THEN they SHALL understand any limitations compared to live problems
4. IF the LeetCode API becomes available again THEN the system SHALL offer to switch back to live data
