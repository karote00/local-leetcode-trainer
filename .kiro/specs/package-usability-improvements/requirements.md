# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical usability issues with the local-leetcode-trainer package that prevent effective adoption and usage by both users and AI assistants. The current package has inconsistent CLI naming, lacks clear AI integration guidance, and doesn't provide sufficient detail for AI assistants to use it effectively without over-engineering solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who installs the local-leetcode-trainer package, I want the CLI command to match the package name, so that I can intuitively use the tool without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs the package globally THEN the CLI command SHALL be `local-leetcode-trainer` instead of `leetcode-trainer`
2. WHEN a user runs `local-leetcode-trainer --help` THEN the system SHALL display the help information
3. WHEN a user runs the old `leetcode-trainer` command THEN the system SHALL display a deprecation warning and redirect to `local-leetcode-trainer`
4. IF the user prefers a shorter alias THEN the system SHALL maintain `lct` as an alternative command

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI assistant helping users with coding practice, I want clear documentation about how to use the local-leetcode-trainer package directly, so that I don't over-engineer solutions or create unnecessary custom implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI assistant encounters a request to use local-leetcode-trainer THEN the documentation SHALL provide explicit "AI Usage Guidelines" section
2. WHEN an AI assistant reads the documentation THEN it SHALL understand the package provides complete functionality without additional implementation
3. WHEN an AI assistant helps a user THEN it SHALL recommend using existing package commands rather than building custom solutions
4. IF a user asks for LeetCode practice setup THEN the AI SHALL direct them to use local-leetcode-trainer commands directly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want comprehensive package inspection capabilities and detailed usage examples, so that I can understand the full functionality before making recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI assistant examines the package THEN the documentation SHALL include detailed command examples with expected outputs
2. WHEN an AI assistant needs to understand package capabilities THEN the README SHALL include a comprehensive "Package Capabilities" section
3. WHEN an AI assistant helps with workflow setup THEN the documentation SHALL provide step-by-step integration examples
4. IF an AI assistant needs to verify functionality THEN the package SHALL include a `--inspect` command that shows all available features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using AI assistance, I want the AI to understand the package's complete feature set, so that it recommends the most appropriate existing functionality rather than building 80% of what I need from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI assistant analyzes the package THEN it SHALL identify all existing features before suggesting implementations
2. WHEN a user requests LeetCode practice functionality THEN the AI SHALL map requirements to existing package features
3. WHEN the AI provides recommendations THEN it SHALL prioritize using existing package commands over custom development
4. IF additional functionality is needed THEN the AI SHALL extend the package rather than replace it

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want clear AI integration documentation, so that AI assistants can effectively guide users to use the package correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is documented THEN it SHALL include an "AI Assistant Guidelines" section
2. WHEN AI assistants read the documentation THEN they SHALL understand common usage patterns and anti-patterns
3. WHEN users ask AI for help THEN the AI SHALL have clear examples of correct package usage
4. IF users need advanced features THEN the documentation SHALL guide AI assistants to the appropriate existing commands
