# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the package usability issues by implementing consistent CLI naming, comprehensive AI integration documentation, and enhanced package inspection capabilities. The solution focuses on making the local-leetcode-trainer package more discoverable and usable by both human users and AI assistants without requiring major architectural changes.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis
- Package name: `local-leetcode-trainer`
- Current CLI commands: `leetcode-trainer` and `lct`
- Main entry point: `bin/leetcode-trainer.js`
- Commander.js-based CLI with 8 main commands
- Rich functionality already exists but lacks AI-friendly documentation

### Proposed Changes
1. **CLI Command Alignment**: Update binary configuration to use `local-leetcode-trainer` as primary command
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Add AI-specific usage guidelines and comprehensive examples
3. **Package Inspection**: Add new `--inspect` command for detailed capability discovery
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality while adding deprecation warnings

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. CLI Command Structure
```
Primary Commands:
- local-leetcode-trainer (new primary)
- lct (existing alias, maintained)
- leetcode-trainer (deprecated, with warning)

Command Categories:
- Core Practice: challenge, test, open, complete
- Configuration: lang/config
- Learning: hint, learn, patterns
- Inspection: --inspect (new)
```

### 2. Documentation Structure
```
README.md sections:
- AI Assistant Guidelines (new)
- Package Capabilities Reference (enhanced)
- Command Examples with Expected Outputs (enhanced)
- Integration Patterns (new)
- Anti-patterns to Avoid (new)
```

### 3. Package Inspection Interface
```javascript
// New --inspect command output structure
{
  packageInfo: { name, version, description },
  commands: [
    {
      name: "challenge",
      description: "...",
      usage: "...",
      examples: [...],
      expectedOutput: "..."
    }
  ],
  capabilities: {
    languages: ["javascript", "python", "java", "cpp"],
    difficulties: ["easy", "medium", "hard"],
    features: ["offline-practice", "ai-collaboration", "progress-tracking"]
  },
  workflows: [
    {
      name: "Basic Practice",
      steps: [...],
      aiGuidance: "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Models

### Command Metadata Model
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  aliases: string[],
  description: string,
  usage: string,
  examples: Array<{
    command: string,
    description: string,
    expectedOutput: string
  }>,
  aiGuidance: {
    whenToRecommend: string,
    commonMistakes: string[],
    bestPractices: string[]
  }
}
```

### Package Capability Model
```javascript
{
  coreFeatures: string[],
  supportedLanguages: string[],
  workflowPatterns: Array<{
    name: string,
    description: string,
    steps: string[],
    aiRecommendations: string[]
  }>,
  integrationPoints: Array<{
    scenario: string,
    recommendedApproach: string,
    avoidPatterns: string[]
  }>
}
```

## Error Handling

### Deprecation Warning System
- Detect usage of old `leetcode-trainer` command
- Display clear migration message with new command
- Provide automatic command translation
- Log usage for potential future removal

### AI Guidance Error Prevention
- Validate AI recommendations against known anti-patterns
- Provide clear error messages when AI suggests over-engineering
- Include "did you mean to use existing command?" suggestions

### Command Discovery Enhancement
- Improved help text with AI-friendly formatting
- Context-aware suggestions for similar commands
- Clear examples for each command usage scenario

## Testing Strategy

### CLI Command Testing
- Test all three command variants (local-leetcode-trainer, lct, leetcode-trainer)
- Verify deprecation warnings appear correctly
- Validate command aliasing works properly
- Test help text formatting and content

### Documentation Testing
- Validate AI guidelines are comprehensive and actionable
- Test example commands actually work as documented
- Verify package inspection output is accurate and complete
- Check that anti-patterns are clearly identified

### Integration Testing
- Test package installation and global CLI availability
- Verify backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Test AI assistant scenarios with new documentation
- Validate package inspection command provides complete information

### AI Assistant Simulation Testing
- Create test scenarios where AI assistants use the package
- Verify AI can discover capabilities without over-engineering
- Test that documentation prevents common AI mistakes
- Validate AI can guide users to appropriate existing commands

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: CLI Command Alignment
- Update package.json bin configuration
- Modify CLI entry point to support new primary command
- Add deprecation warning system for old command
- Test command aliasing and backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Documentation Enhancement
- Add AI Assistant Guidelines section to README
- Create comprehensive command reference with examples
- Document common usage patterns and anti-patterns
- Add integration workflow examples

### Phase 3: Package Inspection Feature
- Implement --inspect command in CLI
- Create capability discovery system
- Add command metadata extraction
- Generate AI-friendly package information

### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement
- Test with real AI assistant scenarios
- Gather feedback on documentation clarity
- Refine command examples and outputs
- Validate anti-pattern prevention effectiveness
