# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an intelligent AI mentor integration system that automatically detects when a user runs learning commands (`yarn lct learn`, `yarn lct hint`) and provides contextual teaching guidance. The system transforms any AI assistant into an expert Algorithm Mentor that can provide personalized, pedagogical instruction based on the specific LeetCode problem the user is working on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning algorithms, I want AI assistants to automatically recognize when I'm using learning commands so that they can switch into teaching mode without me having to explain the context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `yarn lct learn [problem]` THEN the output SHALL include special markers that AI assistants can detect
2. WHEN a user runs `yarn lct hint [problem]` THEN the output SHALL include contextual information that enables AI teaching
3. WHEN an AI assistant reads the output from learning commands THEN it SHALL automatically understand the user wants algorithmic instruction
4. IF the output contains learning command results THEN the AI SHALL adopt an "Algorithm Mentor" persona without being asked

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI mentor to have comprehensive knowledge about the specific problem I'm working on so that it can provide targeted, relevant instruction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning command output is detected THEN the AI mentor SHALL have access to complete problem context including difficulty, patterns, and approaches
2. WHEN providing instruction THEN the AI mentor SHALL reference specific problem constraints, examples, and test cases
3. WHEN teaching THEN the AI mentor SHALL connect the current problem to related algorithmic concepts and patterns
4. IF multiple solution approaches exist THEN the AI mentor SHALL explain trade-offs and when to use each approach

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learning developer, I want the AI mentor to teach me using proven pedagogical methods so that I develop deep understanding rather than just memorizing solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN teaching THEN the AI mentor SHALL use progressive disclosure, starting with concepts before implementation details
2. WHEN explaining solutions THEN the AI mentor SHALL focus on the "why" behind algorithmic choices
3. WHEN providing guidance THEN the AI mentor SHALL ask probing questions to check understanding
4. IF the user seems confused THEN the AI mentor SHALL break down concepts into smaller, digestible pieces
5. WHEN teaching THEN the AI mentor SHALL connect current learning to broader computer science principles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI mentor integration to work seamlessly with existing learning tools so that my workflow isn't disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning commands are run THEN the existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged for human users
2. WHEN AI detection markers are added THEN they SHALL not interfere with normal command output readability
3. WHEN the system is updated THEN existing `lct learn` and `lct hint` commands SHALL continue to work as before
4. IF AI mentor features are not needed THEN users SHALL be able to use learning commands normally without any AI-specific overhead

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want clear structured data about the learning context so that I can provide the most effective teaching experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning command output is generated THEN it SHALL include structured metadata about the problem, difficulty, and learning objectives
2. WHEN hint progression is used THEN the AI SHALL understand what level of guidance the user has already received
3. WHEN teaching approaches are discussed THEN the AI SHALL have access to time/space complexity information and implementation patterns
4. IF the user is working on a specific problem category THEN the AI SHALL understand related problems and concepts to reference
