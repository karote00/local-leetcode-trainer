/**
 * 9. Palindrome Number
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/
 *
 * Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
 * 
 * An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: x = 121
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 121 reads the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: x = -121
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: x = 10
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
