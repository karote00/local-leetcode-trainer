2. 2 steps

### Example 2
**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 45



## Hints

**Level 1:** This is a Fibonacci sequence in disguise

**Level 2:** To reach step n, you can come from step n-1 or step n-2

**Level 3:** Use dynamic programming or optimize space to O(1)
