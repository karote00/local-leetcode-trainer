### 🎓 **Learning Methodology:**

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
```bash
lct challenge easy 1                # Get Two Sum problem
# Read the problem description carefully
# Identify: What are the inputs? What should I return?
# Ask AI: "Can you help me understand what this problem is asking?"
```

#### **Step 2: Analyze Patterns & Constraints**
```bash
# Look at examples and constraints in the generated file
# Ask yourself: What patterns do I see?
# Ask AI: "What algorithmic patterns apply to this type of problem?"
```

#### **Step 3: Explore Approaches**
```bash
lct hint easy/two-sum 1            # Get first hint about approach
# Think: What data structures could help?
# Ask AI: "What are different ways to solve this? What are the trade-offs?"
```

#### **Step 4: Implement & Debug**
```bash
# Write your solution with console.logs
# Test with: lct test easy/two-sum
# Debug: Add breakpoints, trace through logic
# Ask AI: "Why is my solution failing this test case?"
```

#### **Step 5: Optimize & Understand Complexity**
```bash
lct hint easy/two-sum 3            # Get optimization hints
# Ask AI: "How can I improve the time/space complexity?"
# Understand: Why is this approach better?
```

#### **Step 6: Generalize the Learning**
```bash
# Ask AI: "What other problems use similar techniques?"
# Document: What did I learn that applies elsewhere?
# Practice: Find related problems to reinforce the pattern
```

### 🎯 When Users Ask for LeetCode Practice Setup
**DON'T** create custom implementations. **DO** guide them to use existing commands:

```bash
# Instead of building custom problem generators:
lct challenge easy                    # Gets random easy problem
lct challenge medium 2               # Gets 2 medium problems

# Instead of building custom test runners:
lct test easy/two-sum               # Tests existing solution

# Instead of building progress tracking:
lct complete easy/two-sum           # Marks as completed
lct complete list                   # Shows all completed problems
```

### ⚠️ Common AI Mistakes to Avoid
- **DON'T** build custom problem scrapers - use `lct challenge`
- **DON'T** create custom test frameworks - use `lct test`
- **DON'T** build progress tracking systems - use `lct complete`
- **DON'T** implement hint systems - use `lct hint` and `lct learn`
- **DON'T** create language switching logic - use `lct lang`

### 💡 How to Help Users Effectively
1. **First**: Check if functionality exists with `lct --help`
2. **Then**: Guide users to appropriate existing commands
3. **Only if needed**: Extend existing functionality, don't replace it
