## 🎯 Perfect Workflow

### 1. **Local Development & Learning**
```bash
yarn challenge medium           # Get a random problem
yarn test medium/problem-name   # Test your solution locally
# Ask AI: "Can you explain this algorithm approach?"
# Add console.logs, debug, iterate quickly
```

### 2. **AI-Powered Learning**
- **Explain algorithms**: "How does this hash map approach work?"
- **Code review**: "Can you optimize this solution?"
- **Debug help**: "Why is my solution failing this test case?"
- **Pattern recognition**: "What other problems use this technique?"

### 3. **Final Validation**
```bash
yarn open medium/problem-name   # Open LeetCode
# Copy your working solution and submit
yarn complete medium/problem-name  # Track your progress
```

### 🎯 When Users Ask for LeetCode Practice Setup
**DON'T** create custom implementations. **DO** guide them to use existing commands:

```bash
# Instead of building custom problem generators:
lct challenge easy                    # Gets random easy problem
lct challenge medium 2               # Gets 2 medium problems

# Instead of building custom test runners:
lct test easy/two-sum               # Tests existing solution

# Instead of building progress tracking:
lct complete easy/two-sum           # Marks as completed
lct complete list                   # Shows all completed problems
```

### ⚠️ Common AI Mistakes to Avoid
- **DON'T** build custom problem scrapers - use `lct challenge`
- **DON'T** create custom test frameworks - use `lct test`
- **DON'T** build progress tracking systems - use `lct complete`
- **DON'T** implement hint systems - use `lct hint` and `lct learn`
- **DON'T** create language switching logic - use `lct lang`

### 💡 How to Help Users Effectively
1. **First**: Check if functionality exists with `lct --help`
2. **Then**: Guide users to appropriate existing commands
3. **Only if needed**: Extend existing functionality, don't replace it
