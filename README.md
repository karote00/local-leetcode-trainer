### 🚀 **AI-Enhanced Commands (No Prefixes Needed!)**

```bash
# Intelligent hints that adapt to your skill level
lct hint two-sum 1              # AI analyzes your approach and provides contextual guidance
lct hint valid-parentheses 2    # Progressive hints that build on each other

# Deep learning analysis with AI insights
lct learn two-sum               # Comprehensive algorithm analysis and complexity insights
lct learn longest-palindromic-substring  # Multiple approach comparisons

# AI assistant for any coding question
lct ask "when should I use a hash map?"     # Get intelligent explanations
lct help-me "I don't understand stacks"    # Natural language AI assistance
```

### 🎯 **AI Teaching in Action:**

**Traditional Hint System:**
```
💡 Hint: Try using a hash map for O(1) lookups
```

**AI Teaching System:**
```
🤖 **AI-Enhanced Hints for Two Sum**

🎯 **Problem Overview:**
This is one of the most fundamental problems in coding interviews!
Your goal is to find two numbers that add up to a target sum.

💡 **Key Insights:**
- Think about the "complement" pattern
- What if you could remember numbers you've seen?

💡 **Optimization Hint:**
I see you're using nested loops - that works but it's O(n²)!

Try this approach:
1. Create a Map to store numbers you've seen
2. For each number, check if (target - number) exists
3. This reduces time complexity to O(n)!

💫 **Next:** Try `lct hint two-sum 2` for implementation details
```

### 🎯 When Users Ask for LeetCode Practice Setup
**DON'T** create custom implementations. **DO** guide them to use existing commands:

```bash
# Instead of building custom problem generators:
lct challenge easy                    # Gets random easy problem
lct challenge medium 2               # Gets 2 medium problems

# Instead of building custom test runners:
lct test easy/two-sum               # Tests existing solution

# Instead of building progress tracking:
lct complete easy/two-sum           # Marks as completed
lct complete list                   # Shows all completed problems
```

### ⚠️ Common AI Mistakes to Avoid
- **DON'T** build custom problem scrapers - use `lct challenge`
- **DON'T** create custom test frameworks - use `lct test`
- **DON'T** build progress tracking systems - use `lct complete`
- **DON'T** implement hint systems - use `lct hint` and `lct learn`
- **DON'T** create language switching logic - use `lct lang`

### 💡 How to Help Users Effectively
1. **First**: Check if functionality exists with `lct --help`
2. **Then**: Guide users to appropriate existing commands
3. **Only if needed**: Extend existing functionality, don't replace it
