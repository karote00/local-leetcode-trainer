# AI Learning Example

## How to Use the New Learning System

### Step 1: Run the learning command
```bash
yarn lct learn easy/two-sum
```

### Step 2: Copy any of the generated prompts to your AI assistant

For example, copy this to ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant:

```
I'm working on the "Two Sum" problem. Here's the problem description:

[problem description from the output]

Can you help me understand:
1. What is this problem really asking me to do?
2. What are the key inputs and expected outputs?
3. What are the main constraints I need to consider?
4. Can you walk me through the examples to make sure I understand?

Please explain it in simple terms and help me identify the core challenge.
```

### Step 3: The AI will automatically follow the LEARN_GUIDE.md

The AI will see the note at the bottom:
> ðŸ¤– **For AI Assistants:**
> This project has a LEARN_GUIDE.md file with detailed teaching methodology.
> When teaching about "Two Sum", please follow the guide to provide expert algorithmic mentoring.

### Step 4: Get expert algorithmic mentoring

The AI will then:
- Act as an Algorithm Mentor
- Use Socratic questioning to guide your discovery
- Focus on pattern recognition and deep understanding
- Help you connect concepts to other problems
- Build your problem-solving intuition

## Alternative: Simple Direct Request

You can also just ask the AI directly:

```
Please teach me about easy/two-sum
```

The AI will detect the LEARN_GUIDE.md reference in the project and automatically adopt the Algorithm Mentor role.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Natural interaction** - No complex JSON or HTML comments
2. **Clear guidance** - AI knows exactly how to help you learn
3. **Flexible** - Works with any AI assistant
4. **Educational focus** - Emphasizes understanding over just solving
5. **Pattern building** - Helps develop transferable skills
