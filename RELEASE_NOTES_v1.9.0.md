### 2. Database Architecture
```
scripts/dynamic/problems/
├── easy/           # 30 individual problem files
├── medium/         # 20 individual problem files  
├── hard/           # 10 individual problem files
└── index.js        # Comprehensive database manager
```

### 3. Query and Selection Functions
- `getProblem(identifier)` - Get specific problem by ID or name
- `getProblemsByDifficulty(difficulty)` - Filter by difficulty
- `getProblemsByTopic(topic)` - Filter by topic
- `getProblemsByCompany(company)` - Filter by company
- `getRandomProblem(difficulty)` - Smart random selection
- `getStatistics()` - Database analytics

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Variety Testing
```bash
# Multiple runs now generate different problems:
lct challenge easy
# Run 1: Climbing Stairs
# Run 2: Pascal's Triangle  
# Run 3: Valid Parentheses

lct challenge easy 3
# Generated: Pascal's Triangle, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, Valid Parentheses
```

### Performance Testing
- ✅ All 60 problems load successfully
- ✅ Random selection works across all difficulties
- ✅ Query functions perform efficiently
- ✅ Fallback system activates seamlessly
- ✅ File generation works for all problem types

## 📈 User Experience Improvements

### Before v1.9.0
- ❌ Always generated "Two Sum" problem
- ❌ Limited variety with only 15 problems
- ❌ Medium/hard challenges frequently failed
- ❌ Poor user experience due to repetition

### After v1.9.0
- ✅ True variety with 60 different problems
- ✅ Reliable generation across all difficulties
- ✅ Rich problem data for better practice
- ✅ Works offline when LeetCode is blocked
- ✅ Excellent user experience with diverse challenges

## 🛠️ Installation & Upgrade

### For New Users
```bash
npm install -g local-leetcode-trainer@latest
```

### For Existing Users
```bash
npm update -g local-leetcode-trainer
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
lct --version  # Should show 1.9.0
lct challenge easy  # Should generate random easy problem
lct challenge medium 2  # Should generate 2 different medium problems
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Generate Random Problems
```bash
# Single random problem by difficulty
lct challenge easy
lct challenge medium  
lct challenge hard

# Multiple problems
lct challenge easy 3      # 3 random easy problems
lct challenge medium 2    # 2 random medium problems

# Specific problems (still works)
lct challenge two-sum
lct challenge 3sum
lct challenge 1          # By problem ID
```

### Expected Behavior
- **Variety**: Each run generates different problems
- **Quality**: Complete problem data with examples and constraints
- **Reliability**: Works even when LeetCode scraping fails
- **Speed**: Fast problem generation from local database

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

This release maintains full backward compatibility:
- ✅ All existing commands work unchanged
- ✅ Same file generation format
- ✅ Same project structure
- ✅ Same configuration options
- ✅ Existing problems remain accessible

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed variety bug**: Challenge command now generates truly random problems
- **Fixed medium/hard failures**: Robust problem selection across all difficulties
- **Fixed duplicate generation**: Smart avoidance of already existing problems

### Minor Fixes
- Improved error messages with helpful suggestions
- Better handling of network failures
- Enhanced logging for debugging

module.exports = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Two Sum',
  name: 'two-sum',
  difficulty: 'easy',
  description: '...',
  examples: [...],
  constraints: [...],
  topics: [...],
  companies: [...],
  functionSignatures: {...},
  testCases: [...],
  hints: [...]
};
```

### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrates with existing `leetcode-api.js`
- Maintains compatibility with problem manager
- Works with all existing file generation logic
- Supports all current language configurations
