# Release Notes v1.8.2 - Improved AI Learning Experience

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Improvements

### More User-Focused AI Prompts
- **Removed overwhelming template content**: Eliminated the confusing Steps 1-9 that appeared before AI prompts
- **Fixed perspective issues**: Changed from system-centric "What I know so far" to user-focused language
- **Interactive engagement**: AI now asks users about their current understanding instead of making assumptions
- **Natural conversation starters**: Prompts now encourage genuine dialogue between user and AI mentor

### Enhanced Learning Commands

#### `lct learn easy/two-sum`
- Now generates clean, focused prompts that ask AI to engage with user's actual situation
- Removes template-heavy content that was confusing and irrelevant
- AI starts by asking: "What do you understand about this problem so far?"

#### `lct hint easy/two-sum 2`
- Cleaner hint prompts that focus on the specific hint level
- AI guides discovery rather than providing template responses
- More natural mentoring conversation flow

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

### Before (v1.8.1):
```
ðŸŽ¯ **Step 1: What is this problem really asking?**
ðŸŽ¯ **Step 2: What are the key constraints?**
...
**What I know so far:**
- Problem type: Hash Table
- Patterns involved: Two Pointers, Hash Map
...
```

### After (v1.8.2):
```
**I'm working on this problem and would like your help as my Algorithm Mentor.**

Please start by asking me:
- What do I understand about this problem so far?
- Where am I getting stuck or confused?
- Have I attempted any solutions yet?
```

## ðŸš€ User Experience Improvements

1. **Less Overwhelming**: Removed 9 template steps that cluttered the output
2. **More Personal**: Language now reflects the user's actual experience

4. **Natural Flow**: Conversation starts organically based on user's needs

## ðŸ”„ Breaking Changes

None - this is a pure improvement to the user experience without changing functionality.
