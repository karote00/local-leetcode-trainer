# 🚀 v1.10.1: Expanded Hard Problems Collection

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 🔥 12 New Hard Problems Added
We've significantly expanded our hard problems collection with 12 carefully selected challenging problems that cover essential algorithmic patterns for technical interviews.

### 📊 Updated Problem Statistics
- **Hard Problems**: 18 → **30** (+12 new problems)
- **Total Problems**: 113 → **125** (+12 problems)
- **Hard Collection Progress**: 75% complete (30/40 target)

## ✨ New Hard Problems

### 🔗 **Linked List & Pointers**
- **Reverse Nodes in k-Group** - Advanced linked list manipulation with group reversal

### 📝 **String Algorithms**
- **Text Justification** - Complex string formatting and line distribution
- **Valid Number** - Finite state machine for number validation
- **Interleaving String** - 2D dynamic programming pattern matching
- **Scramble String** - Recursive DP with memoization

### 🏗️ **Dynamic Programming**
- **Distinct Subsequences** - String DP with subsequence counting
- **Palindrome Partitioning II** - Optimization DP for minimum cuts
- **Word Break II** - Backtracking with memoization
- **Burst Balloons** - Interval DP for optimal balloon bursting

### 🔢 **Array & Matrix**
- **Maximal Rectangle** - Matrix algorithms with stack optimization
- **Insert Interval** - Array manipulation and interval merging
- **Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** - Advanced data structures (Binary Indexed Tree/Merge Sort)

## 🎯 **Algorithm Coverage**

These new problems cover critical interview patterns:
- **Dynamic Programming**: 5 problems (interval DP, string DP, optimization DP)
- **Advanced Data Structures**: 2 problems (BIT, segment trees)
- **String Processing**: 4 problems (parsing, pattern matching, formatting)
- **Array/Matrix**: 2 problems (interval operations, matrix algorithms)
- **Linked Lists**: 1 problem (advanced pointer manipulation)
