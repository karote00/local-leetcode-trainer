## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

### Example 2
**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

### Example 3
**Input:** nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Follow-up

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Hints

**Level 1:** This is a classic dynamic programming problem (Kadane's algorithm)

**Level 2:** At each position, decide whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one

**Level 3:** Keep track of the maximum sum ending at current position and global maximum
