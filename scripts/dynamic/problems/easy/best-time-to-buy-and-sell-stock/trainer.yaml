      💡 **Dynamic Programming Hint**
            
      This looks like a DP problem! Consider:
      1. **State definition**: What does dp[i] represent?
      2. **Recurrence relation**: How does dp[i] relate to previous states?
      3. **Base cases**: What are the initial values?
      4. **Bottom-up vs Top-down**: Which approach fits better?

      Try defining your DP array first!
