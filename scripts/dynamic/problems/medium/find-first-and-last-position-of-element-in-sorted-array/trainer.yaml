      🚀 **Strategy Planning**
                
      Consider multiple approaches:
      1. **Brute force**: What's the straightforward solution?
      2. **Optimization**: Can you reduce time/space complexity?
      3. **Edge cases**: What special cases need handling?
      4. **Data structures**: Which ones might be helpful?
