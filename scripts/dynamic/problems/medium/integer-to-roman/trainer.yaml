      üöÄ **Strategy Planning**
                
      Consider multiple approaches:
      1. **Brute force**: What's the straightforward solution?
      2. **Optimization**: Can you reduce time/space complexity?
      3. **Edge cases**: What special cases need handling?
      4. **Data structures**: Which ones might be helpful?

      üí° **Need a hint?**
                
      You've been working on this for a while. Here's some guidance:
      - Review the problem examples carefully
      - Consider if you're handling all edge cases
      - Think about the most efficient data structure for this problem
  - type: on_run
    trigger: stderr.match(/TypeError|ReferenceError/)

      üêõ **Runtime Error Help**
                
      Common issues to check:
      - Accessing undefined variables or properties
      - Array index out of bounds
      - Null pointer exceptions
      - Incorrect function calls
  - type: on_run
    trigger: passed === false && attempts > 1

      ü§î **Still working on it?**
                
      That's okay! Debugging is part of learning:
      - Add console.log statements to trace execution
      - Test with the provided examples manually
      - Check your logic step by step
  - type: on_run
    trigger: passed === true

      üéâ **Excellent work!**
                
      You solved it! Reflect on:
      - What approach did you use?
      - What was the time/space complexity?
      - Could it be optimized further?
      - What similar problems could you solve now?

      **Next steps:**
      - Try explaining your solution out loud
      - Consider alternative approaches
      - Look for similar problems to practice
      - Review the time/space complexity analysis

      üó∫Ô∏è **Hash Table Optimization**
            
      This problem might benefit from a hash table!
      - **Map**: Store key-value pairs for O(1) lookup
      - **Set**: Store unique values for O(1) membership testing
      - **Pattern**: Often used to trade space for time complexity

      Consider what you need to "remember" as you iterate!
