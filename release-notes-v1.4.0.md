# 🎉 Local LeetCode Trainer v1.4.0 - Major Configuration & Initialization Improvements

## 🚀 Major Features Added

### ✨ Project-Local Configuration System
- **NEW**: Configuration now stored in user's project directory (`./lct/config.json`)
- **FIXED**: No longer stored in package installation directory (was confusing and global)
- **BENEFIT**: Each project has independent settings and configuration

### 🎯 Proper Project Initialization
- **NEW**: `lct init` command for guided project setup
- **FEATURE**: Creates `./lct/` directory and `config.json` with proper defaults
- **UX**: Clear getting started flow with helpful messages and next steps
- **SMART**: Detects if already initialized and shows appropriate guidance

### ✅ Fixed Default Language
- **FIXED**: Default language is now JavaScript (was incorrectly Python)
- **IMPROVEMENT**: Proper initialization with correct language defaults
- **CONSISTENCY**: Matches package documentation and user expectations

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Configuration Architecture
- Config file location: `./lct/config.json` (per-project)
- Automatic directory creation when needed
- Better error handling with helpful guidance messages
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing functionality

### Enhanced User Experience
- Clear project structure with visible `lct/` folder
- Comprehensive initialization messages with next steps
- Better first-time user onboarding flow
- Helpful tips about .gitignore and project management

## 📋 Perfect New User Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install the package
npm install local-leetcode-trainer

# 2. Initialize your project (creates ./lct/config.json)
npx lct init

# 3. Start practicing with JavaScript (default)
npx lct c easy 1

# 4. Test your solution
npx lct test easy/two-sum

# 5. Get hints if needed
npx lct hint easy/two-sum
```

## 📁 Clean Project Structure

```
my-leetcode-project/
├── package.json
├── lct/
│   └── config.json          # JavaScript default, per-project settings
├── easy/
│   └── two-sum/
│       ├── two-sum.js        # JavaScript files with proper templates
│       └── two-sum.test.js   # 10+ comprehensive test cases
├── medium/                   # Created automatically when needed
├── hard/                     # Created automatically when needed
└── .gitignore               # Can add lct/ if you want local-only settings
```

## 🎯 Previous Issues Resolved

| Issue | Before v1.4.0 | After v1.4.0 |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Default Language** | ❌ Python (incorrect) | ✅ JavaScript (correct) |
| **Config Location** | ❌ Package directory (global) | ✅ Project directory (per-project) |
| **First-Time Setup** | ❌ Confusing, no guidance | ✅ Clear `lct init` workflow |
| **Project Structure** | ❌ Hidden/unclear | ✅ Visible `lct/` folder |
| **User Experience** | ❌ Trial and error | ✅ Guided initialization |

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
If you were using previous versions, your existing problems and progress are preserved. To get the new configuration system:

1. Run `lct init` in your existing project
2. Your existing `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/` folders will continue to work
3. New `./lct/config.json` will be created with JavaScript default

### For New Users
Simply follow the new workflow above - no migration needed!

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

This release has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Empty project initialization
- ✅ Configuration file creation and management
- ✅ JavaScript default language verification
- ✅ Challenge generation with proper file types
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Multi-language support (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++)
- ✅ Comprehensive test case generation (10+ cases per problem)

## 📦 Installation & Upgrade
