# 🎯 Local LeetCode Trainer v1.5.0 - LeetCode-Accurate Problem Format

## 🚀 Major Features

### ✨ LeetCode-Identical Problem Format
The biggest update yet! Problems now look **EXACTLY** like LeetCode:

**Before v1.5.0:**
```javascript
/**
 * LeetCode 1: Two Sum
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * 
 * Find two numbers that add up to target
 * 
 * Topics: Array, Hash Table
 * Companies: Amazon, Google, Apple
 * 
 * TODO: Add problem description, examples, and constraints from LeetCode
 */

function twoSum() {
    // Your solution here
}
```

**Now in v1.5.0:**
```javascript
/**
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 * 
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * 
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6, we return [1, 2].
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
 * - Only one valid answer exists.
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    
};

module.exports = twoSum;
```

### 🐍 Perfect Python Format
Python now uses LeetCode's exact Solution class format:

```python
"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
"""

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        pass

# For testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    # Test your solution here
```

### 🔗 Automatic ListNode Definitions
Linked list problems now include proper ListNode definitions:

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
```

**Python:**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

from typing import List, Optional

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pass
```
